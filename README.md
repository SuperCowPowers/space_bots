# Space Mining Robots
An AutoChess (Battler) where you compete with Space Mining Robots. This is a game about programming (Python) a set of 'bots' with simple behaviours and then just letting them go. It's a bit like Conway's game of life on zoomies (https://playgameoflife.com/). Anyway we just started.. hopefull will be kewl...

The whole point of the game is to mine resources and protect the miner. The more Z-Nite (future mineral) you mine the more ships/upgrades you can make. To protect the miner you have a 'dungeon group' and yes classes matter.. a group of DPS would get wiped quickly.
- Healer = Green
- Tank = Blue
- DPS = Fuchsia
- Miner = Yellow

Narration:
- The Zerg enemy comes in, tank takes position up front. The miner is trying to get his job done (with extra hazard pay). The healer stays protected and heals from the back. At some point the tanks almost dies, throws a protective shield on himself. The healer changes targets and manages to keep the entire team up so we're safe.. at least until the next wave... :)
